# What is Mason Virginia Transfers?
It is a simple tool to search up if your college credits can be transferred to other colleges around Virginia.

## Inspiration
we saw that there is no easy way to find out about transferable credits for all universities in one place. 

## What it does
We made this tool to make it easy for students to search up if the courses they are currently taking can be transferred to other universities across Virginia

## How we built it
We used the frameworks of `Astro` with `Svelte` for the front-end, all the data is located in a folder with json files. We used `Puppeteer` for our web-scrapping method (we did that separately). We are also using `bun` instead of `nodejs` and `npm`

## Challenges we ran into
Having to gather all the data for later use (going to each website and scrapping the courses)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to create the scrapper for the GMU courses site.

## What we learned
How to do proper web-scrapping with `puppeteer`

## What's next for Mason Virgina Transfers
We will all more schools to the database as well as creating a proper and more sophisticated backed database (with SQL).
